## Introduction

This package is meant to make it easy to work with survey-data and create batch reports. 
In comparison to a normal R `data.frame`, the `Survey` class includes and keeps track of attributes
associated with a particular survey, such as the label for each variable (the question),
as well as which variable are *associated* with a particular latent construct.

We can manipualte a `Survey` like a regular `data.frame`, and the internals help
us keep track of labels/associations, how the data has been treated etc. In the end
this allows us to automate tables, plots and reports.

## Creating a Survey

```{r, fig.show='hold'}
# Sample data
sav <- haven::read_sav(system.file("extdata", "sample.sav", package = "reporttoolDT"))

# We have several choices for creating a Survey.
df <- survey(sav)
class(df)

```
